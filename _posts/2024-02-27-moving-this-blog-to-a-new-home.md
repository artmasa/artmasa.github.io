For some time I've been wanting to move my blog to GitHub Pages to have access to Markdown.
I've been hosting it using BlogEngine and it's been a really good experience, but I think I'm going to love the built-in Markdown support.
This is my first try!

I'll be able to tell you more about it in the future.
